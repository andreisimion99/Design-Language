# Design-Language

   The goal of the assignment is to write an interpreter for the Design language. The language is used to draw geometric figures and points.

   Write an interpreter that receives a file with instructions like parameters and writes an SVG file. If there is an error, the output will be ERROR LINE followed by the line number and the error text.

   The program receives two parameters:
     -the file with the instructions
     -the output svg file

   Example of use:  node main.js design.dsn canvas.svg

   This will run the design.dsn file and write the design to the canvas.svg file.
